# Wind Turbine Analysis Tool

# Overview

This repository contains a Python application for analyzing wind turbine performance. 
The tool is designed to calculate and visualize various parameters such as frequency distribution, power curves, and future energy predictions based on user input and turbine data.

# Features

Data Input: Users can select a wind turbine from the available options in the database.
Calculation Engine: The application performs complex calculations, including velocity, frequency, and power curve calculations.
Graphical Visualization: Graphs are generated and displayed using the Matplotlib library to provide a visual representation of the analysis results.


# Requirements

Python 3.11
Required Python packages (specified in requirements.txt)
SQLite database (turbine_data.db) containing turbine data

# Usage

Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application: python wind_analysis.py
Select a wind turbine, input relevant parameters, and click the "Calcular" button.
View the generated graphs and analysis results.
